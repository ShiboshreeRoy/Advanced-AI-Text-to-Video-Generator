# Advanced AI Text-to-Video Generator

A production-ready Python-based framework demonstrating the architecture of an advanced AI text-to-video generation system using object-oriented programming principles.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for generating videos from text input using AI. It demonstrates how different components of a text-to-video pipeline can be organized using sophisticated object-oriented design patterns.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Advanced text analysis with scene detection and sentiment analysis
- High-quality image generation with multiple style options
- Professional audio narration and adaptive background music
- Video assembly with transitions and special effects
- Complete project management system

### Advanced Features
- Parallel processing for faster generation
- Image variation generation
- Sound effect creation
- Subtitle integration
- Batch video generation
- Project export and import
- Detailed logging and error handling

## Architecture

The system is built with the following components:

1. **TextProcessor**: Analyzes input text to extract scenes, sentiment, keywords, and entities
2. **ImageGenerator**: Creates images based on text descriptions with multiple style options
3. **AudioGenerator**: Produces narration, background music, and sound effects
4. **VideoGenerator**: Assembles images and audio into a coherent video with transitions
5. **VideoProject**: Manages the entire video generation process with state tracking
6. **AIVideoGeneratorApp**: Main application class that handles projects and batch processing
7. **Scene**: Data class representing individual scenes with timing information
8. **ProjectStatus**: Enum for tracking project status throughout the generation process

## Usage

```python
from ai_video_generator import AIVideoGeneratorApp

# Create the application
app = AIVideoGeneratorApp()

# Option 1: Quick generation with custom settings
output_video = app.quick_generate(
    text="Your text content here",
    project_name="My Video",
    image_style="cinematic",
    voice_type="professional",
    resolution="full_hd",
    music_genre="orchestral"
)

# Option 2: Step by step generation with more control
project = app.create_project("Custom Video")
project.set_input_text("Your text content here")
project.analyze_text()
project.generate_images(style="abstract")
project.generate_audio(voice_type="dramatic")
output_video = project.create_video(transition="fade")

# Option 3: Batch generation
batch_texts = [
    "First video text content",
    "Second video text content"
]
batch_videos = app.batch_generate(
    texts=batch_texts,
    base_project_name="Batch_Videos"
)
```

## Advanced Usage

```python
# Generate image variations
project.generate_image_variations(scene_id, num_variations=3)

# Export project
export_path = project.export_project("my_project_export.zip")

# Custom speech parameters
project.audio_generator.set_speech_parameters(rate=1.2, pitch=0.1)

# Add subtitles
subtitled_video = project.video_generator.add_subtitles(video_path, scenes)
```

## Implementation Notes

This is a prototype that demonstrates the architecture of a text-to-video system. In a real implementation, you would need to integrate:

- Natural Language Processing models for text analysis (e.g., BERT, GPT)
- Image generation models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E)
- Text-to-Speech models for narration (e.g., ElevenLabs, Amazon Polly)
- Video editing libraries (e.g., MoviePy, FFmpeg)

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

## Future Enhancements

- Web interface for project management
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Cloud-based processing for faster generation
- Multi-language support
- Style transfer between videos
- AI-generated B-roll footage
- Interactive editing capabilities
- Custom model fine-tuning
